# Proposal for Improvement

**Better API Result Type:** Change page entities to an array instead of `Record<string, entity>`. This way, the frontend and user devices don't have to handle complex logic, leading to better performance.

**Caching Mechanism:** Introduce caching to reduce redundant API calls and enhance response times for retrieving menu items.

**Search Functionality:** Add search functionality to the API instead of handling it on the client side.

**Virtual Scrollbar:** Use a virtual box for better performance in menu expansion.
